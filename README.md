# Hello-World
Just another repository

===================
Hi,
I'm just trying to get used to all the glory of Github and this commiting stuff. 
As for myself, I'm a not-se-recent graduate in mechanical engineering trying to find a decent job.
I like to stay fit... well sort of, I train in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu,... also sort of... 
I'm not the most disciplined but I try, the thought is always there. 
So i guess this is it for this.
